Packform - Perl and Ajax Communication Kit -- a Framework for Organized Response Management

This is a library used for quick creation of drop-in forms for web pages.  

There are some associated files available on github at 
https://github.com/zachhh/Packform

Fundamentally, Packform's job is to take your instructions and generate a response from them.
To get the maximum usage out of it, the frontend.js file is necessary.  It provides the inter-
activity of the form by issuing ajax requests on the form submission, and parsing JSON data 
that is returned by Packform.  The associated packform.css file is to provide some functional
css for the page and minimal styling.  

The frontend.js file is not necessary for basic functionality.  It is capable of producing HTML
to be included in an HTML response.  However, this approach loses the gains from ajax, and in 
the end, you just have a web form.
